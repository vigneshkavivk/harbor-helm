Automate your Google Cloud infrastructure through a guided, visual workflow—no gcloud CLI, no manual Terraform, and no context switching between consoles.

The **GCP Cloud Workflow** in CloudMaSa walks you through a standardized process to connect your GCP project, discover existing resources, select infrastructure modules, configure settings, and deploy—all from a single interface. Every action generates auditable, versionable Infrastructure-as-Code in the background, ensuring consistency and compliance.

All GCP deployments are:
- Securely authenticated using service account keys with least-privilege roles
- Pre-validated for permissions and quotas before execution
- Cost-estimated in real time based on Google’s public pricing
- Fully reversible, with automatic rollback on failure
