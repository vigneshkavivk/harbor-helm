You’ll learn:

- How to return to the previous step by clicking the “Back” button — perfect for double-checking your cloud account details or selected modules.
- How to re-review your Provider Details (AWS, region, account ID) and Selected Modules (like ECR, VPC, S3, etc.).
- The importance of verifying your Estimated Cost and Infrastructure as Code preview before proceeding.
- Whether you’re confirming your resource selection or revisiting existing deployments, the intuitive workflow ensures you’re always in control.
