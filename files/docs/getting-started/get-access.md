2. Request an invitation to the platform
3. Once invited, you’ll receive an email with a signup link
4. Complete your profile and start using the app

### If You’re Invited as a Workspace Admin
When a Super Admin invites you with the Admin role, you gain the ability to invite and manage team members within your workspace.

### Your Responsibilities as an Admin:
> Assign Roles Before Inviting
Every new member must be assigned a role that aligns with your organization’s policies. Available roles include:
- DevOps Engineer: Full access to infrastructure automation, CI/CD pipelines, and monitoring tools.
- Cloud Engineer: Access to cloud resource management, cost optimization, and security configurations.
- Member: Limited access (customizable per your workspace policies).

#### Invite New Members
Navigate to Workspace Settings > Team Management.
Click "Invite Members", enter their email, and select a role.
Invitations are sent automatically via email.
Enforce Policy-Based Access
All permissions are role-driven and comply with your organization’s security policies.
You cannot grant permissions outside predefined role boundaries.
